    <h1>Lift Off</h1>
    <p>As we got further an further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally, it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful marble you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man. </p>

        <h2>Can We Visit Planets?</h2>
        <p>Never in all their history have men been able to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p><br> 
        <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center -an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

          <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
          <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
